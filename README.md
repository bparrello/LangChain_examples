# LangChain_examples
LangChain examples for AuroraGPT

These are examples (snippets of code with some text), not full tutorials.
They are organized by category into Jupyter Notebooks.
Each code cell in each notebook is supposed to be a stand-alone piece of
code that can execute independently of the other cells.
I recommend loading them into VSCode for running, but if you are not fond
of Jupyter, please recall that you can export each one as a Python script.
